# Welcome to the Lolnet Adventure Pack Github!

## What is the Lolnet Adventure Pack?

The Lolnet Adventure pack is a 1.7 pack for Minecraft that focuses on Magic and Adventure Mods, and less on Technical ones. Lots of dungeons and ruins to explore while you struggle to survive in the wilderness. Create magical items and spells. Explore new dimensions. Find a village, start a family, and work your way up to being their king! Then put them to work for you.
